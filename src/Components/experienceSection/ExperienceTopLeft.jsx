        Over the past few years, I’ve gained valuable hands-on experience
        through a variety of projects and collaborations. From building
        full-stack web applications to working with embedded systems and IoT,
        I've developed a strong foundation in both software and hardware
        development. I’ve worked closely with teams and consistently aimed to
        deliver clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.
